## Homework3

Polyphonic (four-voice) wind synth, morphing between a clarinet and a flute, with pressure, breath, and an additional control for each. Contains very ugly, repetitive C++ GUI code, but sounds and looks decent.

Design-wise, I continued using my Tron-inspired look.

Thanks to Prof. Michon for the starter code for Audio plugins and for Polyphonic MIDI input, and for the Faust-C++ wrapper. Thanks to Tim for helping me catch my clicking issue.
